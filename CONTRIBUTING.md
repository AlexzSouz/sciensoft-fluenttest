You are welcome to contribute to this project, please clone this repository and go ahead working in your feature branch, after adding something new, submit a Pull Request.

Before doing any significant change, have a look at the existing Pull Requests, one of them may be tackling the same thing.

A piece of good advice to starting contributing is helping me out with existing issues.

**Did you find a bug?**

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](./../../issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](./../../issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behaviour that is not occurring.

- If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. At the moment there are templates for **bugs report** and **feature requests**.

**Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

**Do you have questions about the source code?**
